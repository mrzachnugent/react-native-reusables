# React Native Reusables Starter

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and powered by [react-native-reusables](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    # or
    pnpm start
    # or
    bun start
```

This will start the Expo Dev Server. Open the app in:

- **iOS**: press `i` to launch in the iOS simulator _(Mac only)_
- **Android**: press `a` to launch in the Android emulator
- **Web**: press `w` to run in a browser

You can also scan the QR code using the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your device. This project fully supports running in Expo Go for quick testing on physical devices.

## Adding components

You can add more reusable components using the CLI:

```bash
npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add [component-names]
```

> e.g. `npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add input textarea`

If you don't specify any component names, you'll be prompted to select which components to add interactively. Use the `--all` flag to install all available components at once.
