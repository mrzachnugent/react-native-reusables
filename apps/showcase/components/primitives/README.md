# Primitives

Style agnostic accessible for iOS and Android components

## Unstyled Nature

React Native Primitives provides unstyled components, offering a high degree of customization freedom. By default, the components come without any predefined styles, allowing developers to seamlessly match their app's aesthetics.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is a significant focus within React Native Primitives. We are dedicated to ensuring our components align with accessibility standards. Our ongoing efforts involve designing and testing components with appropriate labels, roles, and behaviors, aiming to provide an inclusive user experience.

### External State Control

These components are designed with almost zero internal state, relying on externally provided state (internal state is used for things like errors and layouts which you can also monitor).
