      <p>Effective Date: July 19, 2025</p>

      <p>
        The React Native Reusables App (“the App”) is an interactive developer tool that allows
        users to explore, preview, and interact with a wide range of UI components and blocks
        provided by the React Native Reusables project. It is designed for developers and designers
        who want to evaluate, learn from, and integrate these components into their own
        applications.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. At this time, the App does not require
        authentication and does not track user behavior, usage statistics, or analytics data.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        No authentication mechanisms are currently implemented. If authentication is added in the
        future, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect that change.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Usage and Sharing</h2>
      <p>Since we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties.</p>

      <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy if features change. If we do, we will revise the
        “Effective Date” at the top of this page. For any significant changes, we may provide
        additional notice within the app.
      </p>
