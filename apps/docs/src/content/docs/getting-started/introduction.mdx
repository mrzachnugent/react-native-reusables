<Card title="Purpose">
  Build your own component libraries with `react-native-reusables`. Copy, paste, and tailor the code to suit your specific requirements. 
</Card>

### Features
- **Universal**: Components, hooks, and utilities for Android, iOS, and the web applications.
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind. Using [radix-ui/primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for web and [rn-primitives](https://rn-primitives.vercel.app/) for native platforms.
- **Incremental adoption**: Use as much or as little as you need at your own pace.
- **Code sharing**: Share code between web and native applications.
- **Customization**: The code lives in your project, not in your `node_modules` folder. You can customize it to your heart's content.
- **Dark mode**: Re-usable css variables for light and dark modes.

### The `react-native-reusables` way

This project aims to provide as little opinionated code as possible. However, some opinionated code is necessary to provide a consistent and easy-to-use experience.

- The CSS variable names are based on shadcn/ui's naming convention.
- Folder structure:

  - `~/components/ui` for components styled with NativeWind.
  - `~/lib` for utilities, hooks, and constants.
